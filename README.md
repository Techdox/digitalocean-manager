# digitalocean-manager
Digital Ocean Manager allows you to create and destory VMs in your Digital Ocean account without having to login to the actual console.

## Setup
Create a API token in your Digital Ocean account and export it as a variable in Linux, for example "export TOKEN={your api key}". This is needed as the Digital Ocean manager looks for this when it runs.
